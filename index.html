        <h1>Good morning students,</h1>
        <p>My name is Maritza Alas, I am TechHire's tutor and will be tutoring you during this next phase of your program.
            <br>I'm sorry I cannot be there with you on your first day of your Coding Academy, but I will be in tomorrow to properly
            introduce myself to you all. </p>
        <p>I was initially going to write up an email for you, but I decided a better way to introduce you to coding would be
            to
            <strong>build a page!</strong>
        </p>
        <h2>Coding Academy is broken up into three parts:</h2>
        <div class="row">
            <ul class="three-parts col-md-4 offset-md-4 text-center">
                <li>
                    <a href="#freeCodeCamp">Free Code Camp</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="firehose">Firehose Prep Course</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="watchAndCode">Watch and Code</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h4 id="freeCodeCamp">You will start off with
            <strong>freeCodeCamp</strong>
        </h4>
        <p>freeCodeCamp is a wonderful resource that provides free lessons on learning to code for web development.
            <br>You will be using freeCodeCamp to learn HTML and CSS, the building blocks for creating web pages.</p>
        <h4 id="firehose">Next, you will move on to
            <strong>Firehose</strong>
        </h4>
        <p>The Firehose prep course (also in three parts) will guide you through creating a portfolio page using HTML5 and CSS3,
            getting started with the fundamentals of computer programming with Ruby and adding some final touches to your
            portfolio page.
        </p>
        <h4 id="watchAndCode">And we've saved the best for last,
            <strong>Watch and Code</strong>
        </h4>
        <p>Watch and Code will walk you through building your first, interactive and fully-functional, web app using HTML5,
            CSS3 and JavaScript.</p>
        <hr width="50%">
        <h2>After Completing Coding Academy</h2>
        <p>You will finish Coding Academy knowing the basics to Web Development. You will understand the fundamentals of computer
            programming, which, if you decide to continue learning, will help you in picking up other programming languages
            faster.
        </p>
        <p>You will leave knowing enough to start building your own web pages. Of course, in order to build something that not
            only looks good, but is also well scripted, you need to practice and keep learning.</p>
        <p>Coding Academy will teach you the basics of 4 programming languages</p>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>Ruby</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
        </ul>
        <p>(Please refrain from referring to JavaScript as Java, THEY ARE
            <strong>NOT</strong> THE SAME LANGUAGE)</p>
        <hr width="50%">

        <h4>Final Notes</h4>
        <p>Whether or not you choose to continue coding after completing the Coding Academy, I hope all of you enjoy these next
            several weeks. I also want to remind you that I am here to help, so if you are having trouble with your code
            or want some clarification on a concept, please let me know.</p>
        <p>Remember that everyone learns at a different pace. Certain concepts might be easier for you to grasp, while other concepts
            will take some time. Make sure you focus on your personal progress and not that of your classmates'.</p>
        <p>I'm sure you've all heard of
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lynda.com">Lynda</a> by now, but I want to emphasize that this site is a great resource and available to you for free with
            the use of your public library card.</p>
